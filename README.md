This project demonstrates deploying a personal portfolio website on an AWS EC2 instance using Git for version control. The task involves merging a feature branch into the `main` branch (default was `master`), updating `index.html` with new content, and committing/pushing the changes to the GitHub repository.

## 🔧 Steps Performed

1. Set up an EC2 server with required dependencies.
2. Initialized a Git repository (defaulted to `master`).
3. Created a new branch for updates, then merged it into `main`.
4. Updated the `index.html` file with portfolio content.
5. Committed and pushed changes to the remote GitHub repository.

## 📁 Files

- `index.html` – Main HTML file for the portfolio page.
- `.git/` – Git directory for version control and branch management.

## 📦 Requirements

- AWS EC2 Instance (Amazon Linux)
- Git
- SSH Access
- A GitHub repository

## ✅ Outcome

Successfully deployed a static portfolio website on EC2 with proper Git branching and version control strategy.
